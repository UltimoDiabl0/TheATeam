Created entire logic for invites, refined database to accept deny add new users and invite users to a group. Created the find time group buttons, and their accompanying pages for logic creation.
refined logout to be acceptable.
Refined groupView to have the ability to look at other users calendars rather than displaying their timeblocks. Updated calendar to have this new logic.

+ Added findTime.js

+ Changed around master.css and calender.js(line 118) code that styled the css for the certain calendar parts to make it look better

+ Added militaryToStandard function into calendar.js and applied it corrected

+ Attempted organization of master.css to help when we want to look back/ style some

Side note, time blocks now with standard time and the edit and delete buttons are getting crowded, potential to change it to make it look more nice in the future
